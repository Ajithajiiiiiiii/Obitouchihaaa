  <h2><u>History</u></h2>
  <p>Delhi, India's historic heart, traces its roots to ancient times, with evidence of settlements dating back to the 6th century BCE. Ruled by various dynasties, it became a prominent center under the Delhi Sultanate and later the Mughal Empire. British colonial influence shaped its destiny, and in 1911, it became the capital of British India. Post-independence in 1947, Delhi emerged as the capital of the Republic of India. Today, the city narrates a rich history through its architectural wonders, from medieval forts like the Red Fort to Mughal marvels like Humayun's Tomb, embodying centuries of cultural and political evolution.</p>

  <p>Delhi, India's capital, is situated in the northern part of the country. It encompasses the expansive Delhi Ridge and Yamuna River's floodplains. The city experiences a diverse climate, with hot summers and chilly winters. Its strategic location has historically contributed to its significance as a political, cultural, and commercial hub.</p>
  <p>The Aravalli Range partly shelters Delhi, and the Yamuna River plays a vital role in its geography. Urbanization has transformed the landscape, fostering a dynamic cityscape that includes historic monuments, modern infrastructure, and green spaces.</p>

Television programming includes two free terrestrial television channels offered by Doordarshan, and several Hindi, English, and regional-language cable channels offered by multi system operators. Satellite television has yet to gain a large number of subscribers in the city.[258]</p>

<h2><u>Utility services</u></h2>
<p>Delhi's municipal water supply is managed by the Delhi Jal Board (DJB). As of June 2005, it supplied 650 million gallons per day (MGD), whereas the estimated consumption requirement is 963 MGD.[157] The shortfall is met by private and public tube wells and hand pumps. At 240 MGD, the Bhakra storage is DJB's largest water source, followed by the Yamuna and Ganges rivers. Delhi's groundwater level is falling and its population density is increasing, so residents often encounter acute water shortage.[157] Research on Delhi suggests that up to half of the city's water use is unofficial groundwater.[158]
In Delhi, daily domestic solid waste production is 8000 tonnes which is dumped at three landfill locations by MCD.[159] The daily domestic waste water production is 470 MGD and industrial waste water is 70 MGD.[160] A large portion of the sewage flows untreated into the Yamuna river.[160]</p>
